# DigitRecognition
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to upload images and get predictions using either a pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Users can select the model they wish to use for the prediction via a dropdown menu.

#### Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images for classification.
Model Selection: Users can choose between an SVM model and a CNN model for predictions.
Real-time Predictions: The app processes the uploaded images and returns predictions in real-time.
Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be clean and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
#### Tech Stack
Flask: Web framework used for building the web application.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for the CNN model.
Scikit-Learn: Used for the SVM model.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing.
Joblib: Used for loading the pre-trained SVM model.
